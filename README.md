Hello, my name is Drake Wheeler and this is my personal GitHub profile.

I am a computer science student at PSU and will be graduating in 2025. I am interested in developing robotics, crypto, or web software. I will use this profile to host some of my personal projects.

In my free time, I am working on a program that compares the conditions for surfing, snowboarding, kiteboarding, and skateboarding close to where I live and tells me which sport is best for today. 
I am coding this program in Python

The programming language I am most familiar with is C++. I have coded many school projects in C++ in I which utilized many different data structures.
